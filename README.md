This is a more advanced version requires some expertise and patience, if you want to start slow as a beginner  please go to [Otto DIY repository](https://github.com/OttoDIY/DIY)

Start by downloading all files here.

## For the hardware
Gather all the off the shelf parts in the BOM file that you'll need for this assembly, then 3d print the latest .stl files and then follow the instruction manual to build your own robot.

## For the programming
1. Download & Install Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software also this driver if you have a clone board: http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html for PC, or http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html for MAC
2. Copy all libraries to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed):
3. Open  for example OTTO_smooth_criminal.ino, make sure in tools you have "Board: Arduino Nano" "Processor ATmega328" and your Otto is connected to the corresponding port
4. Upload code to your Otto and will dance!
5. Make your own dance just modify the program using same functions

### Otto DIY + is  design using Autodesk Fusion 360
So is completely parametric and precise to adjust tolerances
[You can modify it for customization](https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/otto-diyplus) or further improvements!
